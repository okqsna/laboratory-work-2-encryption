> Implementation of secure transmission of messages by using RSA algorithm and <br>
fast exponentiation algorithm in modular arithmetic.

### RSA algorithm <br>
In the implementation of the algorithm we used such libraries:
- <b>Math</b> - for calculations
- <b>Secrets</b> - for generation of 2064-bits prime numbers



### Encryption & Decryption


### User-server communication

### Hash of messages
